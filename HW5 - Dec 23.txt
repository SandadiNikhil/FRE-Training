git reset vs git revert
   - git reset : Moves the branch pointer back to a previous commit and changes the working directory (can be destructive).
   - git revert : Creates a new commit that undoes the changes of a previous commit.

- git merge vs git rebase
   - git merge : Combines two branches, keeping both histories intact.
   - git rebase : Re-applies changes from one branch onto another, simplifying commit history.

- git pull vs git fetch
   - git pull : Fetches and merges changes from the remote repository.
   - git fetch : Fetches changes from the remote without merging them, updating only the local copy.
